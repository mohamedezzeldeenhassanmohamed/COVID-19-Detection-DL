Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines the ability to "See" things. The word "See" is not what you think of it as just what a camera do, capturing moments. But thats not it, "See" means that machine can able to perceive things and understands the difference or relation between the real world physical entities. This state of "See" is we achieved now takes a lot of hard word, research and iterations. We achieved it by solving little pieces of it like Image Classification, Image Segmentation and Object Segmentation, etc.

# Hyperdrive into PyTorch - Tutorial (Dive into Computer Vision in Health Care)

Yeah, as you guessed I am a huge fan of Star Wars. Maybe, I learn Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to build my own C-3PO like the young Anakin Skywalker did but I would build a Bot for Health Care to help Humans in saving the Humanity. As it is the need of the time in this dreadful pandemic. Ok, lets consider building an Bot like see in Star Wars, ability to process what it sees will be our first priority right? Else our C-3PO will be blind ðŸ˜‚.

# Why AI in Health Care is crucial....?

Though many fields can be benificial by the implementation of Artificial Intelligence, it is the field of Health Care which would be benifitted the most and in turn Humanity. It very hard to diagnose X-ray scans, and take decisions deterministically at the right momemt. There is also human errors associated with it. Computers can contribute a ton to Health and Medicine as an "SideKick" to humans(Doctors). I wouldn't say Computer can outperform with absolute percision, it may have fail in some cases. That's why we have computers to assist Doctors.
